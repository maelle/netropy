\title{Redundant Variables & Dimensionality Reduction}
\usage{
redundancy(dat, dec = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Dataframe with rows as observations and columns as variables. Variables must all be observed or transformed categorical with finite range spaces.}

\item{dec}{The precision given as number of decimals used to round bivariate entropies in order to find redundant variables (the more decimals, the harder to find redundancy). Default is 3.}
}
\value{
Matrix indicating which row and column variables are hold the same information. Consider removing one of these for further analysis.
}
\description{
Finds redundant variables in a dataframe. Redundancy is defined as two variables holding the same information (measured by bivariate entropies).
