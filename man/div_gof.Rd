\usage{
div_gof(dat, set1, set2, condition = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{dataframe with rows as observations and columns as variables.
Variables must all be observed or transformed categorical with finite range spaces.}

\item{set1}{column vector of variables in the set
to be tested for independence against those in \code{set2}}

\item{set2}{column vector of variables in set
to be tested for independence against those in \code{set1}}

\item{condition}{column vector of variables to condition the independence test on,
must be different variables than those in \code{set1} and set \code{set2}).
Default empty (no conditioning).}

\item{spec}{either 'pairwise', 'conditional' or 'nested' to specify the model to test}
